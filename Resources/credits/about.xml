This game was originally created as PoC for 2D plataformer using a physics engine, the results where so fun that I decided to converted in a full game.

I decided to release it freely, and the full code is available at github:<br/>

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it, and perhaps you could adventure in create your own game using the provided code base.

Finally, if you like to donate anything to the small team that has completed this game, you could do it so on:<br/>
